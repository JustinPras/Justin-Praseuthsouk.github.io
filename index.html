                        <h3>Who am I? </h3>
                        <p>
                            Hello! I am Justin Praseuthsouk, a recent graduate at the University of Technology Sydney studying a bachelor of computing science majoring in Cybersecurity and Privacy. 
                            Though my major might indicate otherwise, I have an interest in full-stack development, and creating robust solutions to complex business requirements using instinctive strong problem-solving skills. 
                            I am an effective communicator who thrives when developing in collaborative environments or translating complex ideas for key stakeholders. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I graduated highschool at St Patricks College, Sutherland in 2020 but it wasn't until my first year of University that I wrote my first line of code, and since then I haven't wanted to stop. 
                            However, when I do stop you'll find me either serving alcohol to the locals in cronulla, catching up with my friends and family, gaming with mates or learning more about software development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is difficult to remember a time where I haven't been absolutely fascinated by tech. 
                            It probably started when I was a boy playing Pokémon but it has grown to be apart of who I am. 
                            I feel so fortunate to be able to apply myself to an industry that I feel passionate about.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3 id="second-question">Why am I passionate about software development? </h3>
                        <p>
                            Software development combines several areas of life which fulfill me - problem solving, creativity, community, and the ever-evolving nature of the field - into one productive outlet. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Software enables me to bring complex ideas to life, by assembling simple building blocks, into a cohesive and functional whole. 
                            I find it immensely satisfying to create something tangible from a vision in my mind, using only a computer, time and knowledge. 
                            When a challenging function presents itself, nothing beats the feeling when I get it working after hours of research.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe that the software development community is truly unique and fosters my passion for the field. 
                            I value its open-source nature, which allows for the sharing of knowledge and tools freely. 
                            It's inspiring that many of the best software development tools are available for free, which is a testament to the collaborative and supportive culture of the community. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, software development is a field that is constantly evolving in response to the ever-changing technology around us. 
                            To keep up with the latest tools and create cutting edge software, I will need to continuously acquire new knowledge and skills. 
                            This lifelong learning makes software development an exciting and never ending journey to me. 
                            By embracing the challenges of staying relevant in this dynamic field, I believe I will be offered endless opportunities for personal and professional growth.
